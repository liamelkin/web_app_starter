<h1>The Web App Starter</h1>

<p>First off, to get things rolling you'll need to download a copy of the Web App Starter Kit</p>
<p>Below are the steps to get you started</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a new database and import the 'web_app_starter_schema.sql' file</li>
<li>Inside of the 'application/config/database.php' file you will need to update your database name and log-in credentials</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it, if you installed a local copy to your machine you should be able to go to http://localhost/web_app_starter/ and you will see the starting web template for your new application</p>

<small>Note: if you change the name of the root directory or the URL of the directory, you will also need to change the 'base_url' variable to the sitename (default: 'http://localhost/web_app_starter/')</small>
