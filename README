The Web App Starter

First off, to get things rolling you'll need to download a copy of the Web App Starter Kit

Below are the steps to get you started:


1. Add a new database and import the 'web_app_starter_schema.sql' file.
2. Inside of the 'application/config/database.php' file you will need to update your database name and log-in credentials.


That's it, if you installed a local copy to your machine you should be able to go to http://localhost/web_app_starter/ and you will see the starting web template for your new application

Note: if you change the name of the root directory or the URL of the directory, you will also need to change the 'base_url' variable to the sitename (default: 'http://localhost/web_app_starter/')
